    "In the previous notebooks, we introduced the paradigms of **functional programming**. In summary, functional programming is when every function takes in an input and produces an output. We can stack these functions into a pipeline and pass variables, lists and other data structures \n",
    "through our functions:\n",

    "\n",
    "In functional programming, we have a variable and alter the state of the variable by passing it through a number of functions. An alternative to functional programming, is **object-oriented programming**. Object-oriented programming is a paradigm of modeling complex behavior in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at real life objects. Real-life objects are tangible things that we can feel, touch and smell. The computer you're using to read this lesson, is something you can feel and touch. Smell? Perhaps, not as much. However, you use your computer for a specific purpose: to learn data science, to finish work, connect with friends etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in python aren't too different. Although you can't touch or feel objects in python, objects are models of certain things. A **class**, is essentially a blueprint for creating an object. For example, let's say we have three top music artists sitting in front of us: Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Kanye West. Each person is a distinct object, but all three have attributes and behaviors associated with one class: music artists."
